101 Instant Shadowrun Scenarios
===============================


I just want the scenarios!
--------------------------

[Here the scenarios are!](101-Instant-Shadowrun-Scenarios.pdf) Have fun!



Where did this come from?
-------------------------

Save vs DM on RPG.net started a [collection of Shadowrun scenarios](https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?321504-Shadowrun-4th-101-Instant-Scenarios). They maintained a PDF version of the various submitted scenarios. Unfortunately his PDF has not been updated since 2007.

Save vs DM's original PDFs are still available: [printer friendly (white background)](http://www.savevsdm.com/pdf/SR4-101Scenarios-PF.pdf) or [with background](http://www.savevsdm.com/pdf/SR4-101Scenarios.pdf).

I've made a new PDF incorporating the more recent scenarios and hopefully some new ones.  To ensure that other people can maintain this document if I stop doing so, it's on GitHub at [https://github.com/AlanDeSmet/101-Instant-Shadowrun-Scenarios](https://github.com/AlanDeSmet/101-Instant-Shadowrun-Scenarios).

The copyright status is unclear. The original authors seem to have implicitly granted Save vs DM permission to collect them in a PDF; I'm hoping they won't mind if I continue what he did.



There aren't 101 scenarios!
---------------------------

Nope.  101 scenarios was Save vs DM's original goal. We haven't gotten there yet, but perhaps someday.



Can I contribute a scenario?
----------------------------

Please!

If you're a suitably nerdy person, feel free to fork the repository, add your scenario, and submit a pull request.

If that made no sense whatsoever, you can [send me an email](http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/email.html).  Put "Shadowrun Scenario" in the subject, perhaps with the scenario's title.  Please format your scenario like so, based on Save vs DM's original post:

> **Scenario Name** [Scenario Type]
>
> _A one line hook or capsules summary of the scenario._
>
> **Johnson: NAME (AFFILIATION):** A description of the Johnson, as detailed as you feel suitable, along with any possible affiliations and motives. Aim for three to six sentences and try to be brief but descriptive.
>
> **Synopsis:** A synopsis of the scenario, complete with the job, suitable opposition, and anything else you’ll need to work on the fly. You don’t have to lay everything out, but please give enough information to provide the basic ideas for a single session. Aim for five to ten sentences if possible.
>
> **Notes:** Any notes that are particularly important to the scenario but don’t fit into the above categories. This can be anything from a suggested reward, to where you might find stats for the enemies, to suggestions of how to continue the adventure. This section is optional.
>
> **Copyright YEAR by YOURNAME**
>
> **Licensing:** Details on licensing.

I'll consider other licenses, but it's far easier for everyone involved if you pick one of these standard licenses.



What's all this "tex" gibberish?
--------------------------------

The document is formatted using LaTeX, a powerful but cryptic formatting system. You don't need to use it; you can just email me your scenario as noted above.

Getting started with LaTeX is _hard_, and I don't have a recommendation for where to start. You might try [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) or [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), which are designed to make editing LaTeX easier, and without needing to install any special software on your computer.
