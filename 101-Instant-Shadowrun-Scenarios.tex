\begin{scenario}{Bunraku Breakout}
	{B \& E; Extraction}
	{Does the team have what it takes to break into a Yakuza owned Bunraku parlor and spirit away the daughter of a Mafia Don – without getting caught?}
	{Save vs DM}

\johnson{Johnson}{Mafia} The Johnson is a well-dressed and heavy-set Italian man in his mid forties, with salt and pepper hair and a strong nose that looks like it’s been broken at least twice. He speaks in a slightly mumbled Italian accent, and looks every inch the Mafioso – because he is. He meets the team in a small Italian restaurant, even going so far as offering to buy them a nice pasta dinner over arrangements.

\synopsis It seems the local Yakuza kidnapped the wrong Mafia Don’s daughter to “work” in a Bunraku parlor. The Mafia Don is pissed at this affront to his family, and wants to make the Yakuza pay without getting involved himself. Using his extensive contacts, the Don has managed to locate the parlor his daughter was taken to, and also knows that she hasn’t yet been lobotomized. He hires the runners to extract his daughter, and any other Bunraku girl they can smuggle out, just to twist the knife a little. The runners are then to release a rather nasty virus that will wipe all of the data on the stored personality chips on the way out, putting the place out of business for good. The runners are provided with a basic layout of the area, a list of likely guards, and the virus – as well as a time limit of 24 hours. Beyond that, and the Don’s daughter is sure to have been lobotomized and put to work. He offers an excellent reward (double your standard reward), plus an additional 2,000 nuyen for every Bunraku girl smuggled out in addition to his daughter.
\notes  This is a time sensitive mission that works well for groups that are good at silent infiltration and speedy planning. A character who is skilled in hacking will be almost mandatory, though clever groups can either hire one for the job or find another way of implanting the virus. Successfully completing this mission might very well piss off the local Yakuza, but will definitely earn the favor of the local Mafia.

\begin{scenario}{All-Star Defence}
	{Bodyguard; Shadowing work}
	{ Sport is a competitive world. The runners are out to ease the competition for their team}
	{Phantom Stranger}

\johnson{Davey Rohr}{Seahawks} Davey Rohr, as he likes to be known, is a jovial human of about forty-six years of age; a former linebacker who had a couple years competition before his leg blew out, when he moved on to security. Now, over two decades later, he's back with the team that gave him his big shot, though he keeps the lowest profile he can; he's the executive interface between team, security, and the shadows. Sports is big business and you'd be surprised how many jobs they can't admit to.

\synopsis The Seahawks are looking to make the steal of the year - there's a troll running back coming up out the college leagues who covers ground like an elf. One of their scouts is bringing him in this coming Monday, they're wining and dining him for three days to swing him round. A number of other teams are very interested in preventing Joss Wallach from signing with the team, either to lure him away to their own side or simply to prevent him becoming a problem on the pitch. Playing in the rules, they can't make an approach; but their runners can. The PCs find themselves up against other runner crews being run close-in by Rohr's opposite numbers on the other teams over the three-day period. Their main advantage is that these runners will be going for extraction over killing - so far as Wallach's concerned, anyway. But they may well go for the kill if that's all they think they can get.

\notes I wrote the scenario as running five K retainer fee per PC per day plus one K per PC for every confirmed elimination of a non-Seahawk scout (not the runners, but their Johnsons). The main goal, however, was introducing the team to the idea that it isn't just the traditional corps who want to use runners and setting up a new contact. Think about the shit you hear people pulling related to big money sport even nowadays and I'm sure run ideas start pouring in; from drugging the water supply of a visiting team's hotel, preventing star players from making it to the game, the reverse of this scenario, down to a datasteal on a team's playbook codes... 

\end{scenario}

	{Infiltration}
	{The runners get to try out a cutting edge training facility before opening day, but things aren't that simple...}

\johnson{Johnson}{Corporate Fixer} The Johnson is a fairly new fixer on the scene, and heavily under megacorp influence. He's fairly retro in look, mirror-shade eye covers and slick hair. He deals quickly, deeming the job to be straightforward, and emphasises the easiness of the mission in relation to the pay he's been authorized to offer.

\synopsis The runners are brought together to give a security corp's new training facility a test run before it goes live. The facility is organized in a hazard course style environment with physical tasks first, then combat, then specialist (hacking, bomb/electronics defusal, etc.). It becomes apparent that the facility has been sabotaged by a rival corp - and their team is still present in the control facility. The runners must escape the now-lethal complex alive, hopefully providing evidence of the saboteurs, or they may end up being blamed!

\notes This is a scenario I've run several times as an introduction to SR - getting players familiarised with rolling dice for various challenges. The exact details of the course can be left up to the GM's imagination; it could be a boot camp, or an urban combat zone simulation (complete with cardboard hostages and terrorists), or a shadowrunner training course (sneaky!). It's fun to mess with players' minds - let the sabotage be subtle at first, and then hit them with live ammunition and communications jamming. The saboteurs should ideally have been trying to set it up to place blame on the runners, but abort when the team arrives earlier than planned - so they try to take them out instead.

It works with any team makeup - just tailor the challenges to suit your characters. Give them plenty of options in dealing with escape - they could negociate with the saboteurs, or kill them all, or deactivate the jamming and call for backup from the Johnson, etc...

\begin{scenario}{Walk in the Park}
	{Bug Hunt}
	{A local park warden needs some help with vandals. Unfortunately...}
	{Sword Raven}
	{2007-04-15}
	{https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?321504-Shadowrun-4th-101-Instant-Scenarios\&p=7172067#post7172067}

\johnson{Mr. Porter}{City Wildlife Trust} 
A kindly old man who has looked after this inner-city park for a long time. Budgeting changes mean that he no longer has many park rangers to help out with more difficult tasks.

\synopsis Mr. Porter has had reports of vandalism in the local park, the park itself is fairly big, at least a mile square. Of course, it isn't kids... it's insect shamans attempting to construct an inner-city hive for their queen. The park has an ever-growing network of tunnels underneath which means lots of close-quarters bug-hunting for the PCs and they must also find a way to seal off the tunnels for good.

\notes Naturally lethality could be quite high in this scenario (SR4 anyway) so I would personally consider making them fight mostly human mooks before fighting a few bugs and eventually the insect shaman himself BEFORE he can establish the queen in her new hive.

As for reward, the warden is given a budget of 2,000 nuyen for each member of the team who successfully solve the vandalism problem. This isn't a lot but for the difficulty of the task as presented it should be an easy run. Afterwards the warden offers 20,000 nuyen on top of the 2,000 to keep the runners quiet about what they found.

In order to hook the PCs into a low initial reward, I suggest having the park warden a friend of a friend or a direct friend of one of the PCs.

The vandalism reported is occult symbols carved into trees in a tight perimeter around the entrance to the hive.

I would throw in a couple of gangers hanging around the park but these are a red herring and know little to nothing except seeing 'weirdos' late at night.

	{Not everyone can afford medicine. That doesn't mean not everyone needs it.}
	{Phantom Stranger}

\johnson{Doc Dufreyne}{The Street} ``Doc'' Ida Dufreyne runs a back-alley service for the folks in her neighbourhood (just about slum level). In her late twenties, the ork is considered attractive by most of her metatype, but clearly careworn. Any idealism has long been bled out of Ida, and her personality is driven mostly by determination to help 'her community' and bitterness that they're passed up.

\synopsis Ida can't afford to pay corp rates for medical supplies, nor is it likely she'd be allowed to buy if she had the money. Every so often she can scrape together enough money to point a team of sympathetic runners at a shipment through town and pull the trigger, though. Working for Ida you can expect a couple days' notice and the usual route the shipment takes when it's driven through the city, but from there it's up to you. Get the truck stopped and either take over or extract contents, and get them back to Ida without being followed. The corps won't be happy about it, nor will the Lone Star boys, so it's the second part that's tricky.

\notes Ida pays about three K per runner, or six K's medical care on credit if you want to go that way. She's a ready market for new medical primers if you can find 'em. She listens to her community - she'll often pass on news of other low-paying runs to help the locals. Plus, of course, in a month or so she needs another shipment; only this time, they're aware of the risks...
