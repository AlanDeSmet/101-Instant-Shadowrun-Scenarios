I've never met a team that doesn't enjoy this one.

\johnson{Almost Anyone}{Almost Any Affiliation} The Johnson could be Corp, Syndicate, Gang, or even an Independent. Your Johnson wants you to wipe out a Humanis den set up in a warehouse so that they can buy out the land and develop or use the warehouse

\synopsis Humanis Policlub is an organization of non-augmented mundane humans, and while they try to keep a good public image, the truth behind the mask is fairly well known. They are bigots to the core who hate anything that isn't what they are, even Knight Errant tends to turn a blind eye to their ``sudden disappearance''. They own a warehouse in (pick a location that fits into your campaign) that they use as their ``den,'' to hang out, have meetings, prepare for rallies, and do more nefarious things. Your Johnson wants you to wipe them out so that the government puts the land up for auction.

\notes A good run to get players familiar with the game mechanics, just warn them that these are pushovers in comparison to what they'll usually face (be it in combat, deceit, or stealth). Humanis Policlub members are easy targets, so be sure they have numbers on their side (that's the \textit{only} thing on their side). Although they use technology, they do \textit{not} augment their bodies, so there's plenty of low-level tech to take from them (external commlinks, goggles with imagelink, and similar devices). Some of them may have smartguns.

The warehouse is rigged with surveillance cameras. The interior has 5 rooms, only 2 of these rooms have doors to the outside, one in the front and one in the back. These 2 rooms are full of crates (mostly empty, though the GM may put whatever goodies he wants to risk the runners nabbing in them) and a few forklifts (Use the Nissan EZ Eco, from \textit{State-of-the-Art-2073} p.31). There's a central room that's used as a lounge with doors to both front and back as well as the other 2 rooms. The last 2 rooms are a meeting room, and a private room for the den leader.
