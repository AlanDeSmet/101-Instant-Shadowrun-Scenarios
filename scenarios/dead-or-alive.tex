\johnson{Johnson}{Unspecified} One of the runner's street contacts. He can't pay much. In fact, he can't pay at all, but you and he, you're buds, right?

\synopsis Ares is based in Detroit, run Knight Errant, and dabble in cybermancy. OCP is based in Detroit, run Metro South, and created RoboCop. See where I'm going with this? Ares announces the RoboKnight project and is testing it in your sprawl, but they need some bodies. Homeless people are snatched off the street after being profiled at a soup kitchen/homeless shelter, taken to a chop shop and cyberzombitized. One of the people they've grabbed is a friend of one of the runner's street contacts. Find the missing, break into the facility, discover the awful truth, and (optional) blow stuff up.

\notes Have RoboKnight be the working prototype and now they're starting production. Have RoboKnight be one of the runner's missing brother. Have the homeless be in various states -- ready for processing, somewhat modified, and near completion -- will the runners put the half-dead homeless out of their misery? Have some operational RoboKnight units at the facility.
