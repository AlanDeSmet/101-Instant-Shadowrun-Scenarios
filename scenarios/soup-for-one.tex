\johnson{Johnson}{Independent Business}  The Johnson is an aging chinese businessman. He is the proud owner of a chain of chinese restaurants, but his rival has recently been getting the better of him. He is generally loud, and perhaps a touch psychotic. Still, he's perfectly honest about his offer.

\synopsis The Johnson wants his rival dead, and he knows just how he wants it done. His rival has gotten ahold of enough money to establish a plant to mass produce chinese food, and it is scheduled for a health inspection in a few days. He wants the health inspector to find his rivals body face down in the Wonton soup vats when he shows up in the morning. And he wants pictures. 

\notes The group is going to have to kidnap the target and drown him in his own soup vats. They'll have to be able to break into the facility to do this, and not set off any alarms so no one is the wiser come inspection when the facility opens it's doors in the morning. The rival businessman is still a small fry, so all around security is low, both for him and his facility. This should be a pretty basic run without too many dangers, so it should be good for a starting group.
