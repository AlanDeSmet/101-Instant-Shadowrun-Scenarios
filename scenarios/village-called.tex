\johnson{Bert/Brette Johnson}{Out-of-Town} Dressed like a 50-ish small businessman or woman.

\synopsis A public philanthorpist in OutoftheWaysville left some property to a ne'er-do-well, Jim ``Shaky'' Stebbins, and never revised his will when the bum left town for the Big City. Loyal friend Johnson (``Seriously, my name is Johnson, what's the problem?'') wants somebody to find Shaky, who got his name from the DTs. Comb the seedy parts of town, and then go down hill until Shaky is found, live or dead. If the latter, proof that will pass probate is required. Unfortunately, Shaky is hooked on BTL and now ``works'' in a bisexual bordello.

\notes Loyal friend is hoping Shaky is dead, he's the main heir, and so may make an offer. Last known address for Stebbins is several years old.
