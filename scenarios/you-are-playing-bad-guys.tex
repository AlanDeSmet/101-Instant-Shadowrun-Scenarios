\johnson{Johnson}{Terrorist} A respectable businessman that meets the runners in person. He's a face for a terrorist group in the region.

\synopsis The Johnson's group needs cash, quick. There's a big charity auction coming up for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. High society will be there. Rob them all.

\notes You're playing criminals -- the Johnson presents himself as upstanding, needing the items at the auction. Targets are completely altruistic good guys. They've got the money, you want it. If you think they'd balk, thinking they're playing Robin Hood types, have the terrorists kidnap the runner's loved ones or somehow coerce them into robbing the happy rich people and the squeaky-clean organization that helps terminally ill children. Not only release them from jeopardy after the run, but have the Johnson pay them big bucks for their assistance. 

\end{scenario}
