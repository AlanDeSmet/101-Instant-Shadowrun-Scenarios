\johnson{Johnson}{Any} A dead body.

\synopsis  The players are in a realativly secluded part of town, possibly walking down the street, or getting into a car when a man comes running around the corner with a couple of guys in close pursuit. They shoot at the runner and kill him. If the players don't pick up the action, perhaps the shots come a little close to them or the attackers decide to take care of witnesses. In the end, the players will will and the only thing of note on the body will be a chip with files on them. The files are worth money to sombody and somebody else desires to keep them out of their hands. It's now up to the players to dispose of the valuable files as they have no idea who wants them and might not even know what they are. Meanwhile, men will be searching for the files.

\notes  Quick senario for the unplanned game session. It instantly drops into combat and can be scaled to any group. It's a mystery so the GM can string the players along until he desides where he wants to go with it. Resolution can also be scaled to any group and can be a simple hand off of files perhaps with another combat, or a long cloak and dagger game between companies.
