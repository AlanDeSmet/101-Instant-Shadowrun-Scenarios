\johnson{Johnson}{Unspecified} She's one of the higher-ups in the local branch of whatever organization you choose. 

\synopsis Guy breaks into property and steals macguffin. On the way out, he sees something he shouldn't and runs. They have his image. They don't want their secret out there, so he's got to be caught quickly. They don't really care about the stolen items, which is strange, as the items are valuable. Bring him back alive.

\notes When I ran this, They were an altruistic organization run by bug spirits, just like the Universal Brotherhood. The target grabbed some artworks (The Seven Deadly Sins), stumbled across the bugs, and ran. The runners tracked him to an art dealer, nabbed the target, and dropped him off. The organization became a recurring point of interest as the game went on. For your game, it's easy to swap in secretive magical groups, corporations with prototypes, or policlubs with secret agendas. It's probably best to have the organization have a good public face.
